## TOAST > Guide to TOAST Regions
A region refers to the physical location of an independent and geologically separated server. 
Generally, a region is comprised of a standalone power, the so-called available area, and datacenter equipped with a network, and the user may select a region depending on the region and service. 
Feel free to select your region anytime and anywhere to enjoy TOAST services. 

## TOAST Regions

TOAST operates four regions to provide stable global services. 
To support for high availability, an application must be deployed to many available areas or multiple regions. 
TOAST users are allowed to select regions depending on the service area and purpose, but recommended to select those regions where service targets are mainly located so as to get fast response.   

## Location of TOAT Regions 
TOAST is expanding its regions to make its service globally available.
